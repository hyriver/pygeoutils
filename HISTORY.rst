0.16.1 (2024-01-15)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- ``pyproj`` uses its own env variables for SSL certification. This release
  fixes the issue with ``pyproj`` not being able to download the grid database
  when using DOI SSL certification file. This release uses
  ``pyproj.network.set_ca_bundle_path`` for setting the SSL certification file
  given by the user via ``HYRIVER_SSL_CERT`` env variable.
- Ignore ``FutureWarning`` of pandas 2.1.0 for all-NaN columns in ``json2geodf``.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- For ``Attrs`` class, use ``dataclass`` instead for better performance
  and consistency.

0.16.0 (2024-01-03)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Refactor the spline generation functions to make them more efficient,
  more accurate, and more robust. Switched to using ``UnivariateSpline``
  from ``scipy`` instead of ``BSpline``. This allows for more control
  over smoothness of the spline via the ``smooth`` parameter.
  References to BSpline has been removed from the functions and a new
  functionality has been added. The new spline generation functions
  are ``GeoSpline``, ``make_spline``, ``spline_linestring``,
  ``smooth_linestring``, ``spline_curvature``, and ``line_curvature``.
  The ``smooth_linestring`` function now returns a ``LineString`` instead
  of a ``Spline`` object. This function is intended for smoothing a
  ``LineString`` when curvature, radius of curvature, and tangent angles
  are not needed. The ``spline_linestring`` function now returns a
  ``Spline`` object that contains the smoothed ``LineString`` and
  curvature, radius of curvature, and tangent angles. Also, ``line_curvature``
  function can be used to compute curvature, radius of curvature, and
  tangent angles of a ``LineString`` at all point along the ``LineString``.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function called ``gtiff2vrt`` for creating a VRT file
  from a list of GeoTiff files. Note that this new function requires
  ``gdal`` to be installed.
- The ``xd_write_crs`` function now keeps ``spatial_ref`` attribute
  of the input ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset`` to retain
  CF compliance.

0.15.2 (2023-09-22)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add ``geometry_reproject`` function for reprojecting a geometry
  (bounding box, list of coordinates, or any ``shapely.geometry``) to
  a new CRS.
- Add ``smooth_linestring`` function for smoothing a ``LineString``
  using B-splines.
- Make ``make_bspline`` and ``bspline_curvature`` functions public.
  The ``make_bspline`` function uses ``scipy`` to generate a ``BSplines``
  object and the ``bspline_curvature`` function calculates the tangent
  angles, curvature, and radius of curvature of a B-spline at any point
  along the B-spline.
- Improve the accuracy and performance of B-spline generation functions.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Remove dependency on ``dask``.

0.15.0 (2023-05-07)
-------------------
From release 0.15 onward, all minor versions of HyRiver packages
will be pinned. This ensures that previous minor versions of HyRiver
packages cannot be installed with later minor releases. For example,
if you have ``py3dep==0.14.x`` installed, you cannot install
``pydaymet==0.15.x``. This is to ensure that the API is
consistent across all minor versions.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- For now, retain compatibility with ``shapely<2`` while supporting
  ``shapley>=2``.

0.14.0 (2023-03-05)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Ignore index when concatenating multiple responses in ``json2geodf``
  to ensure indices are unique
- Add a new function, called ``coords_list``, for converting/validating input
  coordinates of any type to a ``list`` of ``tuple``, i.e.,
  ``[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]``.
- Make ``xd_write_crs`` function public.
- In ``xarray_geomask`` if the input geometry is very small return at least
  one pixel.
- Add a new function, called ``multi2poly``, for converting a ``MultiPolygon``
  to a ``Polygon`` in a ``GeoDataFrame``.
  This function tries to convert ``MultiPolygon`` to ``Polygon`` by
  first checking if ``MultiPolygon`` can be directly converted using
  their exterior boundaries. If not, will try to remove those small
  sub-``Polygon`` that their area is less than 1% of the total area
  of the ``MultiPolygon``. If this fails, the original ``MultiPolygon`` will
  be returned.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Bump the minimum required version of ``shapely`` to 2.0,
  and use its new API.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Sync all minor versions of HyRiver packages to 0.14.0.

0.13.12 (2023-02-10)
--------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The input ``GeoDataFrame`` to ``break_lines`` now should be in
  a projected CRS.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Significant improvements in the accuracy and performance of
  ``nested_``Polygon```` by changing the logic. Now, the function first
  determines the nested ``Polygon`` by comparing the centroids of the
  geometries with their geometry and then picks the largest geometry
  from each group of nested geometries.
- Add a new function called ``query_indicies`` which is a wrapper around
  ``geopandas.sindex.query_bulk``. However, instead of returning an array of
  positional indices, it returns a dictionary of indices where keys are the
  indices of the input geometry and values are a list of indices of the
  tree geometries that intersect with the input geometry.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Simplify ``geo2polygon`` by making the two CRS arguments optional
  and only reproject if CRS values are given and different.
- Apply the geometry mask in ``gtiff2xarray`` even if the input geometry
  is a bounding box since the mask might not be the same geometry as the
  one that was used during data query.
- Fully migrate ``setup.cfg`` and ``setup.py`` to ``pyproject.toml``.
- Convert relative imports to absolute with ``absolufy-imports``.
- Sync all patch versions of HyRiver packages to x.x.12.

0.13.11 (2023-01-08)
--------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fix an in issue ``xarray_geomask`` where for geometries that are smaller
  than a single pixel, the bbox clipping operation fails. This is fixed by
  using the ``auto_expand`` option of ``rioxarray.clip_box``.

0.13.10 (2022-12-09)
--------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function called ``nested_``Polygon```` for determining nested
  (multi)``Polygon`` in a ``gepandas.GeoDataFrame`` or ``geopandas.GeoSeries``.
- Add a new function called ``geodf2xarray`` for rasterizing a
  ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame`` to a ``xarray.DataArray``.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Modify the codebase based on `Refurb <https://github.com/dosisod/refurb>`__
  suggestions.
- In ``xarray_geomask``, if ``drop=True`` recalculate its transform to ensure
  the correct geo references are set if the shape of the dataset changes.

0.13.8 (2022-11-04)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Improve the performance of ``xarray_geomask`` significantly by first
  clipping the data to the geometry's bounding box, then if the geometry
  is a polygon, masking the data with the polygon. This is much faster
  than directly masking the data with the polygon. Also, support passing
  a bounding box to ``xarray_geomask`` in addition to polygon and ``MultiPolygon``.
- Fix deprecation warning of ``pandas`` when changing the geometry column
  of a ``GeoDataFrame`` in then ``break_lines`` function.

0.13.7 (2022-11-04)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When combining the responses, now ``dask`` handles data chunking more efficiently.
  This is especially important for handling large responses from WMS services.
- Improve type hints for CRS-related arguments of all functions by including string,
  integer, and ``pyproj.CRS`` types.
- In ``gtiff2xarray`` use ``rasterio`` engine to make sure all ``rioxarray`` attrs
  are read.

0.13.6 (2022-08-30)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add the missing PyPi classifiers for the supported Python versions.

0.13.5 (2022-08-29)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Append "Error" to all exception classes for conforming to PEP-8 naming conventions.

0.13.2 (2022-06-14)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Set the minimum supported version of Python to 3.8 since many of the
  dependencies such as ``xarray``, ``pandas``, ``rioxarray`` have dropped support
  for Python 3.7.
- Bump min versions of ``rioxarray`` to 0.10 since it adds reading/writing GCPs.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use `micromamba <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/provision-with-micromamba>`__
  for running tests
  and use `nox <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nox>`__
  for linting in CI.

0.13.1 (2022-06-11)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add support for passing a custom bounding box in the ``Coordinates`` class.
  The default is the bounds of ``EPSG:4326`` to retain backward compatibility.
  This new class parameter allows a user to check if a list of coordinates
  is within a custom bounding box. The bounds should be the ``EPSG:4326`` coordinate
  system.
- Add a new function called ``geometry_list`` for converting a list of
  multi-geometries to a list of geometries.

0.13.0 (2022-03-03)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Write ``nodata`` attribute using ``rioxarray`` in ``geotiff2xarray`` since the
  clipping operation of ``rioxarray`` uses this value as fill value.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- In the ``break_lines`` function, convert ``MultiLineString`` into
  ``LineString`` since ``shapely.ops.substring`` only accepts ``LineString``.

0.12.3 (2022-02-04)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a function called ``break_lines`` for breaking lines at given points.
- Add a function called ``snap2nearest`` for snapping points to the nearest
  point on a line with a given tolerance. It accepts a ``geopandas.GeoSeries`` of
  points and a ``geopandas.GeoSeries`` or ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame`` of lines. It
  automatically snaps to the closest lines in the input data.

0.12.2 (2022-01-15)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new class called ``GeoBSpline`` that generates B-splines from a set of
  coordinates. The ``spline`` attribute of this class has five attributes:
  ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates, ``phi`` and ``radius`` which are curvature and
  radius of curvature, respectively, and ``distance`` which is the total distance
  of each point along the B-spline from the starting points.
- Add a new class called ``Coordinates`` that validates a set of lon/lat coordinates.
  It normalizes longitudes to the range [-180, 180) and has a ``points`` property
  that is ``geopandas.GeoSeries`` with validated coordinates. It uses spatial indexing
  to speed up the validation and should be able to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Make ``transform2tuple`` a public function.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The ``geometry`` and ``geo_crs`` arguments of ``gtiff2xarray`` are now optional.
  This is useful for cases when the input ``GeoTiff`` response is the results of
  a bounding box query and there is no need for a geometry mask.
- Replace the missing values after adding geometry mask via ``xarray_geomask`` by the
  ``nodatavals`` attribute of the input ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset``.
  Therefore, the data type of the input ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset``
  is conserved.
- Expose ``connectivity`` argument of ``rasterio.features.shapes`` function in
  ``xarray2geodf`` function.
- Move all private functions to a new module to make the main module less cluttered.

0.12.1 (2021-12-31)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Refactor ``arcgis2geojson`` for better readability and maintainability.
- In ``arcgis2geojson`` set the geometry to null if its type is not supported,
  such as curved polylines.

0.12.0 (2021-12-27)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add all the missing types so ``mypy --strict`` passes.
- Bump version to 0.12.0 to match the release of ``pygeoogc``.

0.11.7 (2021-11-09)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use ``rioxarray`` for dealing with ``GeoTIFF`` binaries since ``xarray``
  deprecated the ``xarray.open_rasterio`` function, as it's discussed
  in this `PR <https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/5808>`__.
- Use ``importlib-metadata`` for getting the version instead of ``pkg_resources``
  to decrease import time as discussed in this
  `issue <https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/5676>`__.

0.11.6 (2021-10-06)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function, ``xarray2geodf``, to convert a ``xarray.DataArray`` to a
  ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame``.

0.11.5 (2021-06-16)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fix an issue with ``gtiff2xarray`` where the ``scales`` and ``offsets``
  attributes of the output ``DataArray`` were floats rather than tuples (:issue_3dep:`30`).

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function, ``transform2tuple``, for converting ``Affine`` transforms to a tuple.
  Previously, the ``Affine`` transform was converted to a tuple using ``to_gdal()`` method
  of ``rasterio.Affine`` which was not compatible with ``rioxarray``.

0.11.4 (2021-08-26)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use ``ujson`` for JSON parsing instead of ``orjson`` since ``orjson`` only serializes to
  ``bytes`` which is not compatible with ``aiohttp``.
- Convert the transform attribute data type from ``Affine`` to ``tuple`` since saving a data
  array to ``netcdf`` cannot handle the ``Affine`` type.

0.11.3 (2021-08-19)
-------------------

- Fix an issue in ``geotiff2xarray`` related to saving a ``xarray`` object to NetCDF when its
  transform attribute has ``Affine`` type rather than a tuple.

0.11.2 (2021-07-31)
-------------------

The highlight of this release is performance improvement in ``gtiff2xarray`` for
handling large responses.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Automatic detection of the driver by default in ``gtiff2xarray`` as opposed to it being
  ``GTiff``.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Make ``geo2polygon``, ``get_transform``, and ``get_nodata_crs`` public functions
  since other packages use it.
- Make ``xarray_mask`` a public function and simplify ``gtiff2xarray``.
- Remove ``MatchCRS`` since it's already available in ``pygeoogc``.
- Validate input geometry in ``geo2polygon``.
- Refactor ``gtiff2xarray`` to check for the ``ds_dims`` outside the main loops to
  improve the performance. Also, the function tries to detect the dimension names
  automatically if ``ds_dims`` is not provided by the user, explicitly.
- Improve performance of ``json2geodf`` by using list comprehension and performing
  checks outside the main loop.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Add the missing arguments for masking the data in ``gtiff2xarray``.

0.11.1 (2021-06-19)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- In some edge cases the y-coordinates of a response might not be monotonically sorted so
  ``dask`` fails. This release sorts them to address this issue.

0.11.0 (2021-06-19)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Function ``gtiff2xarray`` returns a parallelized ``xarray.Dataset`` or ``xarray.DataAraay``
  that can handle large responses much more efficiently. This is achieved using ``dask``.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Drop support for Python 3.6 since many of the dependencies such as ``xarray`` and ``pandas``
  have done so.
- Refactor ``MatchCRS``. Now, it should be instantiated by providing the in and out CRSs like so:
  ``MatchCRS(in_crs, out_crs)``. Then its methods, namely, ``geometry``, ``bounds`` and ``coords``,
  can be called. These methods now have only one input, geometry.
- Change input and output types of ``MatchCRS.coords`` from tuple of lists of coordinates
  to list of ``(x, y)`` coordinates.
- Remove ``xarray_mask`` and ``gtiff2file`` since ``rioxarray`` is more general and suitable.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Remove unnecessary type checks for private functions.
- Refactor ``json2geodf`` to improve robustness. Use ``get`` method of ``dict`` for checking
  key availability.

0.10.1 (2021-03-27)
-------------------

- Setting transform of the merged dataset explicitly (:issue_3dep:`3`).
- Add announcement regarding the new name for the software stack, HyRiver.
- Improve ``pip`` installation and release workflow.

0.10.0 (2021-03-06)
-------------------

- The first release after renaming ``hydrodata`` to ``PyGeoHydro``.
- Address :issue_3dep:`1` by sorting y coordinate after merge.
- Make ``mypy`` checks more strict and fix all the errors and prevent possible
  bugs.
- Speed up CI testing by using ``mamba`` and caching.

0.9.0 (2021-02-14)
------------------

- Bump version to the same version as PyGeoHydro.
- Add ``gtiff2file`` for saving raster responses as ``geotiff`` file(s).
- Fix an error in ``_get_nodata_crs`` for handling no data value when its value in the source
  is None.
- Fix the warning during the ``GeoDataFrame`` generation in ``json2geodf`` when there is
  no geometry column in the input JSON.

0.2.0 (2020-12-06)
-------------------

- Added checking the validity of input arguments in ``gtiff2xarray`` function and provide
  useful messages for debugging.
- Add support for ``MultiPolygon``.
- Remove the ``fill_hole`` argument.
- Fixed a bug in ``xarray_geomask`` for getting the transform.

0.1.10 (2020-08-18)
-------------------

- Fixed the ``gtiff2xarray`` issue with high resolution requests and improved robustness
  of the function.
- Replaced ``simplejson`` with ``orjson`` to speed up JSON operations.


0.1.9 (2020-08-11)
------------------

- Modified ``griff2xarray`` to reflect the latest changes in ``pygeoogc`` 0.1.7.

0.1.8 (2020-08-03)
------------------

- Retained the compatibility with ``xarray`` 0.15 by removing the ``attrs`` flag.
- Added ``xarray_geomask`` function and made it a public function.
- More efficient handling of large GeoTiff responses by cropping the response before
  converting it into a dataset.
- Added a new function called ``geo2polygon`` for converting and transforming
  a polygon or bounding box into a Shapely's Polygon in the target CRS.

0.1.6 (2020-07-23)
------------------

- Fixed the issue with flipped mask in ``WMS``.
- Removed ``drop_duplicates`` since it may cause issues in some instances.


0.1.4 (2020-07-22)
------------------

- Refactor ``griff2xarray`` and added support for WMS 1.3.0 and WFS 2.0.0.
- Add ``MatchCRS`` class.
- Remove dependency on PyGeoOGC.
- Increase test coverage.

0.1.3 (2020-07-21)
------------------

- Remove duplicate rows before returning the dataframe in the ``json2geodf`` function.
- Add the missing dependency

0.1.0 (2020-07-21)
------------------

- First release on PyPI.
